# pic-a-recipe

### Motivation
We are often taking photos of our food when eating out. How many times have you seen a photo on social media and thought - *"I want to have that"*? But what if you don't know the name of the dish?

A related problem is, when travelling abroad we may eat something we really like, snap a photo of it, then forget what it is called. So we couldn't easily search for the recipe when we get home. 

I would like to **build a usable recipe recommendation system in the form of a web app, where the recommendation is generated based on a photo.**

Another personal motivation for this data science project is to dive deeper into the domain for my Metis Project 4. Like in my previous Metis project ([Project 4 proposal](https://github.com/floraxinru/metisproject04/blob/master/Project4_proposal_v2.pdf)), I want to encourage people to expand their palate, as well as help them recreate dishes similar to the ones theyâ€™ve had in restaurants.
