# pic-a-recipe

### Motivation
We are often taking photos of our food when eating out. How many times have you seen a photo on social media and thought - *"I want to have that"*? But what if you don't know the name of the dish?

A related problem is, when travelling abroad we may eat something we really like, snap a photo of it, then forget what it is called. So we couldn't easily search for the recipe when we get home. 

I would like to **build a usable recipe recommendation system in the form of a web app, where the recommendation is generated based on a photo.**

Another personal motivation for this data science project is to dive deeper into the domain for my Metis Project 4. Like in my previous Metis project ([Project 4 proposal](https://github.com/floraxinru/metisproject04/blob/master/Project4_proposal_v2.pdf)), I want to encourage people to expand their palate, as well as help them recreate dishes similar to the ones theyâ€™ve had in restaurants.


### Design

### Data


### Tools
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, scikit-learn, nltk, Gensim

Deep Learning, CNN: Keras, VGG16

Web App: Flask, HTML, CSS, Jinja2

Scripting: Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code

AWS EC2, GitHub, cookiecutter (datasciencemvp template)


### Results
(currently having trouble uploading/displaying Flask App demo video, will update soon)

### Future Work
I was fairly close to merging the CNN and NLP portions of this project, before I had to make the difficult decision of scrapping the NLP and topic modelling results to focus on making a Flask web app and practice my presentation. For future work I would like to finish debugging that part of the code, in order to reduce the amount of images that would be included in the cosine similarity calculation ("filtering" the images by the NLP-generated topics).

Eventually I would also like to train the model on a larger dataset, so it would perform better when predicting user images. At that point it would be great to make the web app mobile-friendly (probably need to change the CNN architecture to use MobileNetV2, which would be a side project on its own), and to deploy it so other people can use it.
